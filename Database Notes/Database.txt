Transaction -> A series of action to perform a specific task

R(old bal 1st acct)
w(newbie 1st acct)
R(old bal 2nd acct)
w(new bal 2nd acct)
To transfer monry from one to another

Transactsions must have the following characteristics

A) Atomic-> it appears to the user to be a simple task which either all completed or not done at all

B) Consistency -> the transaction must leave the DB in a "consistent" (correct given our intentions) state.

C) Isolation -> to the user, each transation is seperate entity not affected by other users transactions

D) Durable -> if the system crases, the transactions must still be on the system.

E) Transaction Sechedule -> is the list of actions for a transaction. It can show many transactions concurrently progress. Allows DBMS to be aware and to manage concurrency issue.

Let A = an Object

R(A) -> read A
w(A) -> write A
S(A) -> request a shared lock on object A
X(A) -> request an exclusive lock on A

The end of each "Abort" or "commit"
